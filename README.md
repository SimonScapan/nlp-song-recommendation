# Project MURAT - MUsic Recommendation AutomaT

The project was created in connection with the "Data Science Entwicklungen" Module in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) Lecture in the Data Science course at the Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg Cooperative State University (DHBW) Mannheim. An extended documentation is stored as a [Keynote](Documentation_MURAT.pdf).

## How does it work?

### Step 1 - Data generation

* First of all data is crawled from songtexte.de
* Data means: Artist, Songtitle and Lyrics
* The Genre of each Song is crawled directly from google because songtexte.de doesn't has this information
* Dataframe is available on [OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Alb7pfMD-8hrg9IHYF5rvCg25p_ozg?e=xrcst4) cloud

### Step 2 - Sentiment analysis and recommender system

TBD

### Step 3 - Usage

* go to [our website](https://simonscapan.github.io/nlp-song-recommendation/) and choose your favorite song
* MURAT will give you 3 suggestions for similar songs
